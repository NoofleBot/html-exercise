    <p>I was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin and lived there for 19 years,
    <br> in 2016 my parents seperated and I lived with my mom part-time in De Pere, WI,
    <br> the other half of the time I remained in Green Bay living with my dad.
    <br> In 2024 I enlisted in the United States Space Force and lived in San Antonio, Texas
    <br> for two months during basic training, apon completion I was sent to where I currently live,
    <br> Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, to complete technical training. After tech school
    <br> I was assigned to remain at Vandenberg SFB, CA</p>

    <h3>Top cities I'd like to visit:</h3>

      <li>Tokyo, Japan <span>Interesting things to do</span></li>
      <li>London, United Kingdom <span>Interesting History</span></li>
      <li>San Francisco, California <span>Nearby / Close to Silicon Valley & Interesting tech stuff</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tokyo seems like a very interesting place to visit with lots of things to do,
    <br> London would be interestng because of the old archetecture, and history
